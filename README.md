# RSS News Bot

A Discord Bot which simplifies life, RSS feed, AI summarizer, and more!

## Features

### RSS Feed

- **‚åöAutp RSS Checker**: The bot checks the RSS feed for new posts **every 10 minutes**. If there are new posts, the bot will send a message to the channel specified in the server config.
- **üß†AI Powered Summarizer**: The bot uses an AI (New Bing Reversed Engineering) to summarize the RSS feed. This allows the bot to summarize the RSS feed and send the summary to the user via direct message.
- **‚≠êStarboard**: The bot uses a starboard to store starred messages. This allows the bot to store starred messages and send them to the starboard channel.

### Bot

- **üóÑÔ∏èCaching**: The bot includes a caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated API requests. It caches data such as RSS feed entries and summarized content, allowing for faster retrieval and reduced load on external services.
- **üåêMulti-Server Support**: The bot is capable of running on multiple servers simultaneously. It can be configured to work with settings on each server.
- **‚ÜôÔ∏èSlash Commands**: The bot uses Discord's slash commands to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the bot.
- **üîãMongoDB Database**: The bot uses **MongoDB** to store data. This allows the bot to store data persistently and allows for easy retrieval of data.
- **‚ö†Ô∏èError Reporting**: The bot uses **Sentry** to report errors. This allows the bot to report errors to Sentry, which can then be used to debug the bot.
- **üõ°Ô∏èTypeScript**: The bot is written in TypeScript. This allows for type checking and better code quality.
