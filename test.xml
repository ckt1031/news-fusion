        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experts are urging public health bodies to launch their own period tracking apps as an alternative to commercial options. A new report warns that women's personal data is at risk of being harvested by private companies through these apps. The data, which includes exercise, diet, medication, and sexual preferences, is a goldmine for consumer profiling and could lead to job discrimination, health insurance issues, and cyberstalking. The report calls for better governance of the femtech industry and suggests public health bodies, like the NHS, should develop transparent apps that prioritize user privacy and allow data to be used for medical research with user consent. The femtech market is expected to be worth over $60 billion by 2027, highlighting the urgent need for secure and trustworthy alternatives.]]></summary>

Mozilla believes this will make it harder for competing browsers to offer the same AI-enhanced features, potentially giving Chrome an advantage. Mozilla has voiced its opposition to Google's proposal to add AI-based APIs to Chrome, fearing that developers will create apps optimized for Gemini and, by extension, Chrome. Mozilla engineer Brian Grinstead argues that web developers should be able to choose the AI model that suits their application, rather than being steered towards Gemini by Google's implementation. Mozilla is also concerned about Google leveraging Chrome's market share to dominate the AI model market. Google has defended its approach, with engineer Domenic Denicola stating the company isn't trying to pick winners.
