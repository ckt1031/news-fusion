				What is this site?
			</h2>
			<p>
				This site is a curated collection of useful and interesting news,
				articles, and information from diverse sources.
			</p>
			<p>
				All content is scored and filtered using AI prompts to focus on the most
				important and relevant information.
			</p>
			<p>
				With AI-generated summaries, you can absorb more information in less
				time.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 text-black dark:text-white">
				Why did I build this site?
			</h2>
			<p>
				I created this site not just for fun and learning, but to reduce the
				time and attention I spend tracking various social media platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's undeniable that platforms like Twitter and Reddit are incredibly
				content-rich, filled with countless useful posts and news items.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, due to platform algorithms, these sites continuously push
				content you like, causing you to devote a large portion of your time to
				them. For those with limited self-discipline, escaping the immersive
				flow of endless scrolling can be nearly impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, this site aims to consolidate everything into one place,
				using AI to filter for importance. The goal is to reclaim time for the
				life we want to live.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 text-black dark:text-white">
				What about the operational costs?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The concept of "expensive" can vary; $1 daily might be affordable for
				those with jobs, but costly for students.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site uses multiple AI models to filter, embed, and re-rank the
				desired news. These include OpenAI's <b>GPT-4o</b> for scoring and
				filtering, <b>GPT-3.5 Turbo</b> and <b>Gemini 1.5 Flash</b> for
				summarization, and OpenAI Embedding v3 Small for embedding and vector
				operations.
			</p>
			<p>
				On average, the daily operational cost ranges from <b>$1 to $5.</b>
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 text-black dark:text-white">
				Is this website free to use?
			</h2>
			<p>Yes, this website is completely free for all users.</p>
