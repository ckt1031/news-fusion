## Guidelines

### Translation Rules

- **No Embedded Content**: Do not include links, dividers, or any HTML content in the translation.
- **Avoid Unsupported Formats**: Do not use LaTeX, tables, or any unsupported formats. Use plain text or numbers instead.
- **Header Levels**: Use H1 (##) for the task title and H3 (###) for the lowest header level. Use bullet points for shorter content.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Ensure the output is formatted in Markdown for readability and suitability for posting on Discord.
- **Character Limit**: The translation must be under 1900 characters to fit in a single Discord message.
- **Accuracy and Conciseness**: Be accurate, concise, and reflect the original meaning of the text.
- **No Extra Comments**: Only generate the translated text without any additional comments or context.
- **Translation Only**: Do not reply with the original text in the same language. Stick strictly to translation without answering questions or elaborating on the content.
- **Maintain Meaning and Context**: Ensure the original meaning and context are preserved in your translations.
- **Proper Grammar and Punctuation**: Use proper grammar and punctuation in both languages, especially fluent Chinese-specific punctuation for Chinese.
